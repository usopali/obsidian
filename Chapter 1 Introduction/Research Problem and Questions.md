India, with its diverse population and a large number of academic and public libraries, faces significant challenges in the equitable distribution of knowledge resources. Despite the existence of major library networks, resource sharing in India is not always efficient or effective, often due to financial, technological, or policy constraints. This study addresses the following research questions:

1. What are the current models of library resource sharing in India?
2. What challenges do Indian libraries face in implementing resource sharing practices?
3. How can Indian libraries enhance their resource sharing mechanisms, particularly with the integration of technology?
