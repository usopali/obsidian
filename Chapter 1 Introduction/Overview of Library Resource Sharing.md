Library resource sharing refers to the practice of multiple libraries collaborating to exchange materials, information, and services to expand the range of resources available to users. It involves various forms of inter-library cooperation, including interlibrary loans, document delivery services, and the shared use of digital databases and electronic resources. Resource sharing reduces the duplication of purchases, optimizes the use of limited budgets, and ensures that users, regardless of their geographical location or institutional affiliation, have access to a wide array of resources.

In countries like India, where financial and infrastructural limitations often restrict access to information, resource sharing can democratize access to knowledge. With the growing number of academic institutions, public libraries, and specialized information centers in India, resource sharing becomes critical in fostering intellectual growth and supporting research.
