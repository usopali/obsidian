Theoretical models of resource sharing typically focus on principles of cooperation, reciprocity, and mutual benefit. Libraries enter into resource-sharing agreements to ensure that the resources available at one institution can be accessed by another. The advent of digital technologies and the Internet has added new dimensions to these models, allowing for the sharing of not only physical items but also digital content such as e-books, journal articles, and multimedia resources.
