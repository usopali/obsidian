The concept of resource sharing among libraries is not new and has evolved over centuries. Early forms of interlibrary cooperation were mostly informal, relying on personal networks and agreements. With the rise of formalized education and the expansion of libraries in the 20th century, resource sharing became a more structured practice. Initiatives such as the creation of bibliographic databases, union catalogs, and interlibrary loan systems significantly enhanced the ability of libraries to collaborate.
