Globally, several successful models of resource sharing exist. For example, the OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) provides shared cataloging services and facilitates interlibrary loans across thousands of libraries worldwide. In the UK, the British Library Document Supply Service (BLDSS) enables access to a wide range of research materials. Such models offer valuable lessons for Indian libraries in enhancing their own resource-sharing capabilities.
