Several national and regional initiatives have been undertaken to promote resource sharing among Indian libraries.

#### INFLIBNET

The Information and Library Network (INFLIBNET) is a major initiative by the University Grants Commission (UGC) aimed at connecting university libraries across India. It offers access to e-resources, databases, and digital libraries, playing a pivotal role in academic resource sharing.

#### DELNET

The Developing Library Network (DELNET) is another prominent network that promotes resource sharing among libraries. It facilitates interlibrary loans, document delivery, and access to a wide array of bibliographic and full-text databases.

#### National Library of India

As the largest library in India, the National Library of India has a significant role in fostering resource sharing. Its vast collection of manuscripts, books, and digital materials is made available to other libraries through various sharing mechanisms.
